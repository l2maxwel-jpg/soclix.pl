<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create a complete, pixel-perfect clone of the website . The request is to replicate the entire mechanism and functionality of the product.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:
1.  Create a full clone of .
2.  Implement multi-language support for English, Russian, Polish, Latvian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian.
3.  Create a user account section (личный кабинет) that allows connecting multiple computers to one account.
4.  Replicate the My Streams page functionality as shown in a user-provided video, which includes a table of orders parsed from stream comments with inline editing capabilities.
5.  Implement a filtering system for the streams table (by code, color, size, quantity).
6.  Before scanning a stream, a modal should appear asking for pre-configuration details (codes, colors, sizes) to improve AI accuracy in parsing comments.

**User's preferred language**: Русский (Russian)

**what currently exists?**
A frontend-only clone of  has been created using React and mocked data. This includes:
-   Home, Pricing, and Contact pages.
-   Multi-language support (EN, RU, PL, LV, UK, BE) with a language switcher in the navbar.
-   A mocked user authentication flow with Login and Register pages.
-   A mocked User Dashboard for managing connected devices.
-   A redesigned My Streams page that replicates the layout from a user-provided video, featuring an editable table for stream orders and filtering inputs.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was trying to fix a bug where a pre-configuration modal fails to appear on the My Streams page. This modal is supposed to pop up after the user inputs a stream URL and clicks the Find button, allowing them to specify valid product codes, colors, and sizes to aid comment parsing. The user reported the bug and provided a video demonstrating the expected behavior.
*   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent
*   **User Testing Done:** Y

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   Issue 1: Pre-configuration modal on Streams page does not appear (P0)
*   Issue 2: Language selection is not persistent and resets on page navigation (P1)

Issues Detail:
-   **Issue 1:**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent wrote the code to implement the modal in , but the  event on the Find button does not trigger its display. A check of the browser logs showed no relevant errors.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Analyze the latest user-provided video () to fully understand the expected trigger and modal behavior.
        2.  Thoroughly review .
        3.  Inspect the state management () responsible for the modal's visibility.
        4.  Verify the  handler on the Find button is correctly wired to update the modal's state.
        5.  Ensure the Shadcn  component is correctly implemented and its  prop is bound to the correct state variable.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a critical feature requested by the user to improve the core functionality of parsing stream comments for orders.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

-   **Issue 2:**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. The agent acknowledged the issue but prioritized feature development.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Install  package.
        2.  Update  to use the language detector plugin and configure it to cache the selected language in .
        3.  Ensure the application correctly reads the language from  on initial load.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To provide a seamless user experience by persisting the user's language preference across sessions and page navigations.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Backend Implementation and Integration (P0):**
    *   Implement user authentication (registration and login) using FastAPI and MongoDB.
    *   Create database schemas and API endpoints for:
        *   : to store user credentials and profile information.
        *   : to manage computers linked to a user account.
        *   : to store information about scanned streams.
        *   : to store orders parsed from comments.
    *   Develop a backend service to process a stream URL, scrape comments, and use an AI model to parse them based on pre-configured rules (codes, sizes, colors).
    *   Replace all mock data in the React frontend with live API calls to the FastAPI backend.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Frontend Clone:** Created a complete frontend replica of  with mocked data.
-   **Multi-language Support:** Integrated  for English, Russian, Polish, Latvian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian translations.
-   **User Dashboard (Mock):** Built frontend pages for Login, Registration, and a Dashboard to manage devices.
-   **My Streams Page v1:** Overhauled the page to match a user-provided video, implementing an editable data grid and filter inputs.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1:** Language selection is not persistent across page navigations. The agent noted this was due to  not being used but moved on to the next feature.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
-   **Internationalization:** , 
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (planned)
-   **Database:** MongoDB (planned)

**key DB schema**
Not yet implemented. Planned schemas: , , , .

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains the bug related to the non-appearing modal. This is the primary file for the current task.
-   : The configuration file for multi-language support that needs modification to fix the language persistence issue.
-   : Main application component containing routing and context providers.
-   : Contains the mocked authentication logic.
-   : The mock data source for the My Streams page.
-   : Directory containing all JSON translation files.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  implementation needs to be updated to use  for persisting the user's language choice.

**key api endpoints**
None implemented yet. The application is frontend-only with mocked data.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The user is highly detail-oriented and frequently provides screen recordings to specify requirements. Always analyze these videos carefully before implementation.
-   The current highest priority is to fix the pre-configuration modal on the . The user has provided a video () that must be reviewed to understand the exact expected behavior.
-   After the current bug is fixed, the next major phase will be building the backend and integrating it with the frontend to replace all mocked functionality.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
None.
